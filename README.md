It is never too easy to spin off a test hadoop, spark or hive cluster with few nodes virtually on your local computer!  I have provided few Vagrant-puppet modules for you to do it yourself.  To try any of the modules, please make sure you have these:

##### Prerequisite:

1) download VirtualBox first at: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and install it.

2) download a version of Vagrant that suits your machine at here: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html and install it.

3) run these commands: 

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
vagrant plugin install puppet
vagrant plugin install vagrant-puppet-install
```
